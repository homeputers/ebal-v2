# Song Sets

## Overview
Song Sets let you bundle arrangements into reusable sequences for nights of worship, youth services, or recurring gatherings. Each item tracks transpose and capo adjustments, so you can drop the set into a service with confidence.

## Prerequisites
- Admin or Planner role to manage song sets.
- Songs and arrangements prepared in the catalog.

## Step-by-step
1. **Create a set.** From the Song Sets list, click **New Set**, name it (e.g., “Youth Night Opener”), and save.
2. **Open the set builder.** Select the set to view its detail page with add-and-arrange tools.
3. **Pick a song.** Use the song search input to find the title you want.
4. **Choose an arrangement.** Select the specific arrangement; a preview line shows song title, key, tempo, and meter.
5. **Set transpose and capo.** Enter semitone shifts (−6 to +6) and capo position (0–7). The key summary updates to reflect sounding and shape keys.
6. **Add the item.** Click **Add to set** to append it to the list in order.
7. **Reorder items.** Drag the handle beside any item to rearrange the set; changes persist immediately.
8. **Tweak existing items.** Adjust transpose/capo sliders or remove songs inline. Toggle the flats/sharps control at the top to view keys the way your team prefers.
9. **Edit set details.** Rename the set from the action menu if its focus changes over time.

## Examples
- **Label preview:** An item might display “Living Hope — Key E • 72 BPM • 4/4” with a key summary “Key E → F (+1), Capo 2 (shapes in D).”
- **Seasonal reuse:** Build an “Advent Morning” set once, then add it to multiple December services without reconfiguring keys.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use the flats toggle when planning for horn sections; they can confirm enharmonic spellings instantly.
- Keep transpose adjustments within comfortable ranges (the editor clamps at ±6 semitones to help).
- Leverage sets as starting points for services—copy the song order, then add readings or notes per service.
- Remove unused items promptly so the arrangement cache stays focused on the charts you actually use.
