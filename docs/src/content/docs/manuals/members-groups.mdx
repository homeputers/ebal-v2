# Members & Groups

## Overview
The Members and Groups areas help you manage everyone involved in worship ministry and assign them to the teams they serve with. Use these pages to keep contact details current, track instruments, and curate focused groups for scheduling.

## Prerequisites
- Admin or Planner role to create, edit, or delete members and groups.
- Member records for each person you intend to assign to a group.

## Step-by-step
1. **Review the member list.** Use the search bar to filter by name or instrument, then page through results if you manage a large roster.
2. **Add a new member.** Select **New Member**, fill in display name, instruments (comma-separated), optional contact info, and birthday fields, then save to create the profile.
3. **Update or remove members.** Open the context actions beside any member to edit their details or permanently delete the record (after confirming the prompt).
4. **Create a group.** From the Groups page, choose **New Group**, name the team (e.g., "Vocalists"), and save.
5. **Assign people to a group.** Open a group, search for a member using the typeahead picker, click **Add**, and repeat for each participant. Remove members with the **Remove** button when they roll off a team.
6. **Keep rosters current.** Edit group names inline, or adjust member information at any time. Changes sync automatically to the rest of the app.

## Examples
- **Roster hygiene:** Add instruments like `Vocals, Acoustic Guitar` so planners can filter quickly.
- **Group assignments:** Create separate groups such as "Band", "Vocals", and "Tech" to drive service planning.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use consistent instrument names (e.g., "Electric Guitar" instead of variations) to make search predictable.
- Capture email and phone details so reminders can go out from one place.
- Enter birthday month/day to plan celebrations or schedule around key dates.
- Periodically audit groups to remove inactive members and keep rehearsal communications accurate.
