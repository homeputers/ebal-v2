# Arrangement Editor

## Overview
The Arrangement Editor is where you capture the musical specifics for each song version. It pairs a structured form for key, tempo, and meter with a live ChordPro preview that mirrors what musicians will see in services, sets, and printouts.

## Prerequisites
- Admin or Planner role with access to song management.
- A song selected so you can create or edit its arrangements.

## Step-by-step
1. **Set the musical key.** Enter the base key (e.g., `G`) to define the arrangement’s starting point.
2. **Add tempo and meter.** Optionally include BPM (30–300) and a meter such as `4/4` or `6/8` to inform rehearsal pacing.
3. **Paste ChordPro lyrics.** Use the lyrics textarea for chords like `[G]` inline with lyrics. The editor normalizes line endings automatically.
4. **Check the preview.** Watch the right-hand pane as you type to confirm chords align above lyrics or inline based on your layout selection.
5. **Use transpose controls.** Test different keys with the **Transpose Up/Down** buttons; the preview updates instantly without altering the stored chart.
6. **Switch sharps/flats.** Toggle between enharmonic spellings to suit your team’s preference, especially when testing transpositions.
7. **Adjust layout.** Choose **Above** to show chords above lyrics (default) or **Inline** to embed them directly in the text.
8. **Save the arrangement.** Submit the form to make the arrangement available in services, song sets, and plan exports.

## Examples
- **Simple verse with directive:**
  ```chordpro
  {title: Great Is Thy Faithfulness}
  {comment: Verse 1}
  [C]Great is Thy [F]faithfulness, [C]O God my [G]Father
  ```
- **Preview testing:** Transpose the chart up two semitones to verify Bb instruments still read comfortable shapes.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Keep one arrangement per distinct key or instrumentation so transposition history stays clear.
- Use `{comment:}` blocks for band cues and `{title:}` for section headers; the preview renders both.
- Remember that transpose and sharp/flat toggles are for preview only—stored data remains in the key you set.
- If you copy lyrics from another source, double-check spacing; empty lines show as intentional breaks in the preview.
