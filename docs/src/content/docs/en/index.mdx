# Ebal v2 Documentation

Welcome to the living knowledge base for Every Breath And Life. This site collects the manuals, how-to guides, and technical references you need to plan services with confidence.

> **Note:** These docs are a work in progress. Start with the sections in the sidebar or use the search bar to jump straight to a topic.

## What is Ebal v2?

Ebal v2 is the next iteration of our worship team planning tool. It helps leaders coordinate song selections, arrangements, rehearsal notes, and service orders so teams can focus on ministry.

## Getting started

- Review the **Manuals** section for deep dives into features and workflows.
- Use the **How-To** guides for quick answers to common tasks.
- Check the **Reference** pages for configuration details and domain concepts.

If you spot something missing, open an issue or PR so we can continue improving the documentation together.
