# Songs & Arrangements

## Overview
Use the Songs area to curate your ministry songbook, record authorship and CCLI details, and manage multiple arrangements per song. Arrangements store key musical data—keys, tempo, meter, and ChordPro lyrics—so the whole team stays aligned.

## Prerequisites
- Admin or Planner role to add or edit songs and arrangements.
- At least one arrangement per song before it can be scheduled in services or sets.

## Step-by-step
1. **Search your catalog.** Filter by title or apply a tag chip to narrow the list. Click a song title to open its detail page.
2. **Add a song.** Select **New Song**, supply the title, optional CCLI number, author, default key, and comma-separated tags, then save.
3. **Edit or delete songs.** Use the actions beside each row to update details or remove a song you no longer use.
4. **Review arrangements.** On a song’s detail page, view existing arrangements in table form, including key, BPM, and meter.
5. **Create an arrangement.** Choose **Add Arrangement**, then use the editor to set the musical key, tempo, meter, and paste your ChordPro lyrics. Save when the preview looks correct.
6. **Update or remove arrangements.** Open the action buttons in the arrangement list to tweak details or delete the entry entirely.

## Examples
- Use tags such as `Advent`, `Upbeat`, or `Communion` to build quick thematic filters.
- Track CCLI numbers so reporting can happen directly from the catalog.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Keep default keys accurate; downstream tools (sets, services) use them when suggesting transpositions.
- Maintain one arrangement per key or instrumentation rather than overwriting a single file—this preserves history.
- When editing, note that lyrics accept full ChordPro syntax, including `{comment:}` and `{title:}` directives.
- Delete arrangements cautiously; services or sets referencing them will lose access to the chart.
