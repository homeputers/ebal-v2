# Services

## Overview
The Services workspace lets you map out an entire worship gathering. Build a plan by adding songs, readings, and notes, drag items into a meaningful flow, and generate both shareable and print-friendly views for your team.

## Prerequisites
- Admin or Planner role to create and modify services.
- Songs and arrangements already in your catalog for music items.

## Step-by-step
1. **Create the service.** From the Services list, click **New Service**, set the start date/time and optional location, then save.
2. **Filter the schedule.** Use search and date filters to find existing services quickly.
3. **Open the plan builder.** Select a service to reach the detail page, then use the left column to add plan items.
4. **Add items.** Choose the item type:
   - **Song:** Pick a song, select an arrangement, review the key summary preview, and add optional notes.
   - **Reading or Note:** Enter free-form notes (Scripture references, transitions, announcements).
5. **Organize the flow.** Drag the handle on each item to reorder. Changes save automatically in the background.
6. **Edit notes in place.** Update any item’s notes field; blur the textarea to persist your changes.
7. **Manage the service.** Use the action buttons to edit service metadata, remove items, or delete the service when it’s no longer needed.
8. **Share the plan.** Click **Plan View** to open a read-only page (URL includes a `share` token) that leaders can distribute.
9. **Print the run sheet.** Select **Print** for a formatting-optimized layout and trigger your browser’s print dialog.

## Examples
- Draft a Sunday gathering with songs, a Scripture reading, a communion note, and benediction instructions in separate plan items.
- Share the plan link with volunteers so they can view the order without logging in (the share token controls access).

## Tips & Best Practices
- Add notes describing transitions (e.g., "Acoustic vamp into prayer") so everyone knows what happens between songs.
- The song preview shows key, tempo, and meter pulled from the arrangement—use it to verify you picked the right version.
- Keep drag-and-drop tidy by collapsing sections you’re done editing before moving on to the next block.
- Use the plan’s print view during rehearsal to capture last-minute annotations directly on paper.
